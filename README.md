# ATtiny84-Breakout
Simple PCB to allow you to program the ATTiny84 with the Sparkfun Tiny AVR programmer

The Sparkfun Tiny AVR programmer is a great tool that really simplifies the process for programming the ATTIny85, 
however the Tiny84 can be a bit more complicated. I decided to create a small PCB that allows you to  connect
the ATTiny84 directly to the AVR programmer for programming and it's also spaced for use on a breadboard for
prototyping.

The PCB has been shared on OSHPark https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/cLa6gMR7
